# Contribution Documentation

The key words "DO, DO NOT", "AVOID" and "CONSIDER" are to be interpreted in the same as same such words in [Framework Design Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines).

## Code Style Guidelines

### Naming

**✔️ DO** prefix interface names with the letter `I`.

If you encounter cases where the word you use for the interface name begins with I then use two I. For example, `IInstance`.

**✔️ DO** use Pascal Casing for type names, namespace names, as well as method and property names, and constant and non-private field names.

**✔️ DO** prefix private field names with an underscore.

**✔️ CONSIDER** using adjectives for interface names.

Use verbs if there is no adjective available for the concept. 

**❌ DO NOT** use hungarian notations.

**❌ DO NOT** prefix nor postfix any symbol name with dollar sign (`$`).

**❌ DO NOT** use non-English characters in names.

As C# is designed in English and is meant to be written in English, using any other language than English makes it feel out of place, and it can induce time cost as you need to switch between input methods.

**❌ DO NOT** use romantised words unless describing a foreign concept and romantised word is the standard or popular way of referring to it.

For example, Hanyu shall not be used to refer to Chinese language; but using Pinyin to refer to Chinese Pinyin is absolutely okay.

**❌ DO NOT** postfix type names with `Enum` or `Flags`.

If you are naming a flags enum which is used to modify the behaivour of some API, use `Options` or similar.

**❌ DO NOT** prefix enum names with the letter `E`.

For example, use `VehicleOptions` rather than `EVehicleOptions`.

### General Styles

**✔️ DO use file-scoped namespaces.**

Unless in circumstances you need to use a single `.cs` file library, you must use file-scoped namespaces. However, you should avoid those libraries. Use NuGet whenever possible.

**✔️ DO** place imports after file-scoped namespaces.

**✔️ DO** fully qualify names of imports inside file-scoped namespaces.

By default, ReSharper would shorten names inside file-scoped namespaces. The`editorconfig` file have been modified to make ReSharper do the exactly opposite, however if you choose to override `editorconfig` options with ReSharper options, you will have to manually set `Prefer fully qualified using name at nested scope﻿` to `true`.

**✔️ DO** use Allman style curly braces.

**✔️ DO** indent with four spaces without tabs.

**✔️ DO** follow Framework Design Guidelines; if you don't want to buy it or don't want to read it, [here is a digest of it that is useful](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/coding-guidelines/framework-design-guidelines-digest.md).

**✔️ CONSIDER** using `ReadOnlySpan<char>` instead of `string` for parameters on methods that iterates such string parameter.

**❌ AVOID** using `this.` unless absolutely necessary.

### Types

**✔️ DO** prefix interface names with the letter `I`.

**✔️ DO** use Pascal Casing for type names.

### Type Members

**✔️ DO** place `readonly` after `static`.

**❌ DO NOT** declare write-only properties.

If you need to expose a value that is set-only, use a method.

### Unit Tests

**✔️ CONSIDER** use underscore to separate the subject being tested and the condition tested with, in names of Unit Test methods.

## Inline XML documentation guideline

## Types

**✔️ DO** describe the responsiblities of a type in its summary.

**✔️ CONSIDER** using third-person singular present indicative for the first word in type summaries.

For example, "provides" and "represents".

## Constructors

**✔️ DO** use the `Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="type name" /> (type kind).` format for constructor summaries.

For example:

> Initializes a new instance of the `Panaroid` class.

**❌ AVOID** using the word `Create` or `Creates`, or any declensions of it.

It its reported that some analysers would enforce `Creates` rather than `Initializes a new instance of...`. In this case, you would want to disable this analyser or the particular rule that enforces `Creates`.

### Properties

**✔️ DO** prefix`Gets or sets...` for read-write property summaries, and prefix `Gets...` for read-only property summaries.

**✔️ DO** prefix `Gets or sets a value indicating whether...` for read-write boolean properties, and prefix `Gets a value indicating whether...` for read-only boolean properties.

## Fields

**❌ AVOID** using `Gets or sets...` or similar prefixes for field summaries.

## Commit Guidelines

**✔️ DO** follow the Conventional Commits standard:

https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

For external contributions this is not absolutely necessary, but please for the sake of readability, use the convention.

The type of the commit may be one of the following:

- 'build': Modification of Solution File (.sln), Project File (.csproj), Build Properties (.props), and other MSBuild files. Not including adding or removing NuGet packages as dependencies.

- 'chore': Changes that not adds feature nor removing feature, and is not associated with an issue. Misc works, etc.

- 'ci': Changes to CI configuration files and scripts.

- 'docs': Documentation only changes (that includes README and other files).

- 'feat': New feature.

- 'fix': Bug fixes.

- 'pref': Performance improvements and fixes.

- 'refactor': A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.

- 'style': Changes that do not affect the logic and the meaning of code.

- 'test': Solely add, modify or remove tests.

**✔️ DO** use `revert` commit type and make the description as `Revert commit <commit hash>` if the commit reverts a commit.

The scope of the commits shall be one of the following:

- 'events': Hover and Click events.
- 'component': Chat component classes, ChatColor classes.
- 'serialization': Serialization namespace.
- 'misc': Generic documentation and other parts.

**✔️ CONSIDER** not specifing scope if you are modifing `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
