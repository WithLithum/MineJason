MineJason - a Minecraft Raw JSON text format parser and utility library for C#
(C) WithLithum 2023-2024

Purpose
-------

This library exists to solve the issue of parsing, and constructing, Raw JSON
text format (also known as chat components), which is used both internally and
by commands to display text.


Usage
-----

To parse, simply use System.Text.Json and parse the Raw JSON format as
'ChatComponent'.

Newtonsoft.Json is not currently supported and may not be supported in the
future, however this is at my future consideration if requested.
